Refactored some unit tests and implementations within those unit tests.
I'm about to start the SimpleSocketServer refactoring, if there is anything I can improve upon.

I've also done a little research & decided I'll separate the backend of this project from the frontend, which
has accidentally occurred anyway. Django will send REST requests to all this code I've written here and get a REST
response which contains the necessary data needed to present to users.

Once I've set up some sort of frontend, i.e. basic catalog fetches, I'll apply a Continuous Delivery pipeline to all of
this.

Future plans aside,
I've been trying to wrap my head around this race condition issue that doesn't appear in the unit tests. So... I need to
replicate the environment more accurately within the unit test. And reproduce the issue to find if any exceptions are
being thrown in unit test.

While trying to wrap my head around this, I've realized my structure is too cognitively intensive. I need to map out
the solution and see if it looks strange from a simple sketch diagram.
