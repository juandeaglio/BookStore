Further modified the styling of the webpage. Added some mock pictures. I want to create a multi-line title, each
title line is limited to 22 characters, or simply just figure out some way to cut off excessively long titles
so that the spans don't grow larger than the picture size. Probably requires some HTML/JS or CSS work.

Next is to create a navbar which allows us to navigate the store. I want each book in the catalog to re-direct to the
store and allow you to add them to the cart. I think I might end my work at the catalog. I want to begin working on
some sort of blog page and finally actually build out the portfolio which links to either of these projects along
with my personal experience.
