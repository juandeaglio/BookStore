Refactored some unit tests and implementations within those unit tests.
I'm about to start the SimpleSocketServer refactoring, if there is anything I can improve upon.

I've also done a little research & decided I'll separate the backend of this project from the frontend, which
has accidentally occurred anyway. Django will send REST requests to all this code I've written here and get a REST
response which contains the necessary data needed to present to users.

Once I've set up some sort of frontend, i.e. basic catalog fetches, I'll apply a Continuous Delivery pipeline to all of
this.
