Finishing up development. Set up a docker container to locally test ubuntu stuff. Running a CI pipeline thru
GitHub, using GitHub actions. Not as much CD as I wanted, I'm not sure how to do that with GitHub actions.
I'm sure it's possible, but I'm not sure how to do it. I'll have to look into it. Deployed the code to an
Azure VM. Noticed there was an issue with nginx.conf being set up with the wrong IP address. You end up getting
a request to a localhost on port 8091 for the APIs. In the process of fixing it, just involves getting the current
IP address with a curl to icanhazip.com. This is teaching me a lot of CI/CD issues, especially with hosting
web servers. I want to potentially figure out how to dynamically grab the domain of the azure VM I'm hosting on.
Maybe I can use some of the azure APIs to fetch it and make the changes, but I'd have to figure out how to automatically
set it up so that it fits into the CI workflow.

I didn't consider dynamically setting up IP addreses. I mostly stuck to localhost for the sake of test, but when
deploying and trying to use things over the public internet, they broke because of the configuration of nginx and
django being wrong.
