I've finished the BDD test cases for adding stuff to a catalog. Now I'm creating a frontend and spitballing some ideas
for creating a mock of my book store webpage.

I'm going to implement some unit tests, so I can get a better idea of how to iteratively put together the correct
layout that I want. I'm also going to experiment with some different HTML elements such that I can create a clean
modern UI to display a catalog and extrapolate that to other pages.

Next up, unit testing my frontend code (not the APIs).
